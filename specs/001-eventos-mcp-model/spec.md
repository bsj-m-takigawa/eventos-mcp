# Feature Specification: eventos MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-eventos-mcp-model`  
**Created**: 2025-09-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Ëá™Á§æ„Çµ„Éº„Éì„Çπ„Åß„ÅÇ„Çã„Ç§„Éô„É≥„ÉàÁÆ°ÁêÜ„ÉÑ„Éº„É´„ÅÆeventos„Å´„Åä„Åë„ÇãMCP(Model Context  protocol)„Çí‰ΩúÊàê„Åó„Åü„ÅÑ\

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract: eventos event management tool, MCP creation, API reference
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: eventos service, MCP protocol, API integration
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark API endpoint details as needing clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Define MCP client interactions with eventos
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must enable MCP operations
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí eventos resources, MCP tools, API responses
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Verify all MCP operations are covered
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an AI assistant or automated system, I want to interact with the eventos event management platform through standardized MCP tools, so I can help users manage events, attendees, and related resources without requiring direct API knowledge.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an AI assistant with MCP capabilities, **When** it needs to retrieve event information from eventos, **Then** it can use MCP tools to query and receive event details in a structured format
2. **Given** a user requesting event creation through an MCP-enabled client, **When** providing event details, **Then** the system creates the event in eventos and returns confirmation
3. **Given** an MCP client managing attendees, **When** updating registration information, **Then** the changes are reflected in the eventos system
4. **Given** a request for event analytics, **When** querying through MCP tools, **Then** the system returns formatted attendance and engagement metrics

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: API rate limits are exceeded]?
- How does system handle authentication failures with eventos API?
- What occurs when attempting to access events without proper permissions?
- How are partial failures handled during bulk operations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide MCP tools for retrieving event listings from eventos
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable event creation through MCP tool invocation
- **FR-003**: System MUST support event modification operations (update, delete)
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide attendee management capabilities (list, add, remove, update)
- **FR-005**: System MUST expose event analytics and reporting functions
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle authentication with eventos API using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication method - API key, OAuth, bearer token?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST return structured responses compatible with MCP format
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide error handling for API failures and invalid requests
- **FR-009**: System MUST support pagination for large result sets
- **FR-010**: System MUST expose ticket/registration management functions
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide venue and location management tools
- **FR-012**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: real-time event updates via webhooks or polling?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: multi-tenant scenarios if applicable]
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide search and filtering capabilities for events
- **FR-015**: System MUST support bulk operations where applicable

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Event**: Core entity representing an event in eventos (title, date, location, capacity, status)
- **Attendee**: Participant registered for an event (name, contact info, registration status)
- **Ticket**: Registration or ticket type for an event (type, price, availability)
- **Venue**: Location where events are held (address, capacity, amenities)
- **Organizer**: Entity responsible for managing events
- **Registration**: Record of attendee registration for specific event
- **Analytics**: Aggregated data about event performance and attendance

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous  
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

### Notes on Clarifications Needed
1. **Authentication Method**: The specific authentication mechanism for eventos API needs to be clarified
2. **API Endpoints**: Exact endpoints and their capabilities from the eventos API documentation
3. **Rate Limiting**: API rate limits and handling strategies
4. **Real-time Updates**: Whether the system should support webhooks or polling for updates
5. **Multi-tenancy**: If eventos supports multiple organizations/tenants and how MCP should handle this
